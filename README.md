# Django_Online_Banking_System_With_Fraud_Detection
> *NB:* This project uses dummy data to detect fraud and thus is deeply flawed. It is important to note that the project
> doesn't take into consideration the user-behaviour, location etc.
> However, this is a wonderful project to show you how you can create a ML-based project in django
